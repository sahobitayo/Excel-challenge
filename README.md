# Excel-challenge

In this project I will be using the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as I attempt to uncover some market trends.


- I used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.
  - I created a new column 'O' called `Percent Funded` that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.
  
- I used a conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `Percent Funded` column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and blue at 200.
  - I created a new column 'P' called `Average Donation` that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.
  - I created two new columns, one called Category at Q and another called Sub-Category at R, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.
  - I created a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze my initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per **category**.
  - I created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table you have created.
  - I created a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze the initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.
  - I created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table you have created.

- The dates were stored within the deadline and launched_at columns use Unix timestamps. 
  - A new column named Date Created Conversion was created that will use this formula to convert the data contained within launched_at into Excel's date format.
  - I created a new column named `Date Ended Conversion` that will use [this formula](https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/2473-excel-timestamp-to-date.html) to convert the data contained within deadline into Excel's date format.
- I created a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of `state`, rows of `Date Created Conversion`, values based on the count of `state`, and filters based on `parent category` and `Years`.


In addition to this, further visualizations were made. In a new sheet, 8 new columns: `Goal`, `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, `Number Canceled`, `Total Projects`, `Percentage Successful`, `Percentage Failed`, `Percentage Canceled` were made



- The amount of count successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the appropriate ranges. The the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled were populated

- The percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range were found and also a line chart that shows this.


##  Observations
From the visulaizations, a report which answered the following questions could me made
1. What are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

**BONUS** 
- Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.
- Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

###                                     Kick Start My Chart
1) From the Data provided, we can conclude that most kick starter campaigns originate from the United States of America as that is the country with the most projects. Additionally, we can conclude that most of the Kickstarter campaigns are plays. Lastly, we can conclude that if successful campaign should be created, the best move would be for it to fall into a rock category as that has proven to be the most successful campaigns with a 100% success rate based on the data. 

2) **Lack of Previous Data**: The main limitation of this dataset is that there is no representation with the populations of the dataset. The most recent 4,000 campaigns were analyzed out of 300,000 campaigns. The sample size of about 1.3% is not big enough to show the true trends of Kickstarter campaigns especially when thereâ€™s no method for data collection and just shows the most recent campaigns. External factors happening in the world could have affected the success of each campaign that was not accounted for. It would be better is the data was spread across multiple dates instead of just the most recent date.

3) **Pie Chart**: Show the percentage of a value as each slice represents a different category. We can see how each subcategory looks compared to the other subcategories.  
**Bar chart**: This can be used to show a distribution of data points and comparison across different groups. We can see which groups have the most and least in common as well as lowest and highest values.

#### BONUS
1)	Based on the data, the median summarizes the data more meaningfully. This was observed from the boxplots of the unsuccessful and successful backer count values.
2)	Based on the data, there is a greater variability in backer count in successful campaigns than unsuccessful ones. This makes sense because although successful campaigns typically require greater number of backers, it can also have a smaller backer count if the average donation is higher. Unsuccessful campaigns will always have a smaller backer count as a larger backer count would turn the unsuccessful campaign successful.
